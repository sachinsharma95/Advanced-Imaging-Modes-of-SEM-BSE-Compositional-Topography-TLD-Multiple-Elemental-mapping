<h2>To understand the advanced imaging modes of scanning electron microscopy</h2>
<p>
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is a powerful tool used extensively in materials science for high-resolution imaging and analysis of sample surfaces and microstructures. SEM offers advanced imaging techniques that provide additional information about sample composition, crystallographic orientation and topography. Advanced SEM imaging modes include Backscattered Electron Imaging (BSE), Through-Lens Detection (TLD), Multiple Elemental Mapping, Selected Area Electron Channeling, and Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD).
